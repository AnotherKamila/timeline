        The beginning of the Universe, of space and time and matter and everything.

        The whole universe, and all of matter and energy, was condensed in a point, and it
        immediately started expanding like crazy. It was hot and messy and didn't make much sense.

        We have absolutely no idea what happened in the first $10^{-43}$ seconds, or why. At this
        point, the energy density was so high that nothing we know is of use. Actually, TODO write a
        good good description.
